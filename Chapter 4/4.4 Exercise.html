<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>posted by BGB, <time datetime="2012-11-15" pubdate>November 15, 2012</time></p>
<p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique
called sous vide. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food
(usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is
precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be
cooked to. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes
it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p>

<p>Next month, we will be serving <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill
Hollandaise</strong>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us
before November 30.</p>

   <p>Location:<br>Baker's Corner, Seekonk, MA</p>
   <p>Hours:<br>Tuesday to Saturday, <time datetime="11:00">11am</time> to <time datetime="00:00">midnight</time></p>
